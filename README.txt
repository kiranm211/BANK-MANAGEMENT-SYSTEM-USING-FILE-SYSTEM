Title : Bank management system using structures and file systems in c
    Tools and languages used : ubuntu 18.04 os, gcc compiler, c language 
    Description: This project was to demonstrate the under standing of C concepts and implement them. In this project I used structures to form the  basic structure for storing the information in the file system. There was two faces for the project (Bank Employees  and customers ) each can access the same file to manipulate the same data with different options to interact with the file system
